# Kaito Beta (plugin.video.kaito)

This addon is a rewrite of the origianal Kaito addon made by SwagOtaku. 

All credit goes to SwagOtaku.

## Development has ended. 

Hey there, me and my team decided that it was best to end development for this addon. Reason why we ended development for this addon is cause it was starting to become more like Seren and it was starting to become very slow and unfortunately we could not develop a fix for it so we decided to start fresh. We didn't really like Kaito Beta in the first place cause most of the code was very difficult in the beta and we just couldn't figure out most of the code so we decided to start fresh.

## We Are Starting Fresh

Me and my team are now called Team Otaku and we are working on a new anime addon called Otaku. Otaku is a fork of Kaito 0.0.10 and we decided to improve the crap out of it instead. It's basically the same as Katio Beta but it's alot faster, some old features are back and better then ever, we have a list of things to complete, alot of new features and new menu items will be coming in the near future. 

We hope you guys like it and we hope you guys could contribute and give us feedback about our addon.
